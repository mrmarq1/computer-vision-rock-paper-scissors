# Computer Vision RPS

This project will leverage [Teachable-Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to create an interactive version of the classic 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' game. The game will allow the user to play against the computer using their own camera.

## Milestone 1: Set up environment

- Cloned AiCore repo and set up local environment.

## Milestone 2:
- Using Teachable-Machine, created an image model with 4 classes: 'Rock', 'Paper', Scissors' and 'Nothing' (denoting none of the previous).
- Trained model on 754 images (captured via my own webcam) for each class and downloaded tensorflow file and labels text file to local machine.
- Pushed aforementioned files to repo.
