# 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' Interative Game (Computer Vision)

This project will leverage [Teachable-Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) to create an interactive version of the classic 'Rock-Paper-Scissors' game. The game will allow the user to play against the computer using their own camera.

## Milestone 1: Set up environment

- Cloned AiCore computer-vision-rock-paper-scissors repo and set up local environment for development.

## Milestone 2: Created Teachable-Machine model
- Using Teachable-Machine, created an image model with 4 classes: 'Rock', 'Paper', Scissors' and 'Nothing' (denoting none of the previous).
- Trained model on 754 images (captured via my own webcam) for each class so model can eventually properly categorise gestures from data provided during game.
- Downloaded tensorflow file and associated labels text file to local machine.
- Pushed aforementioned files to repo.
- Began updating README to document project.

## Milestone 3: Install the dependencies
